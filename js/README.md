# javascript

this script can be added to your website (maybe) with this link:
```html
<script src="index.js" 
    id="tester"
    width="100%"
    height="90vh"
    box-height="2.5vh"
    padding-base="5vh"
    padding-alt="2.5vh"
    link="https://roxcelic.love"> 
</script>
```
presumably anyway im not to sure on most aspects of this
changing the styles of the elements used in the script wont have an effect unless you change the background color

## that is all
