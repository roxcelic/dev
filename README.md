this is where i will host my programs of fun

## below is a list of what this repo holds:

    python - currently it holds a program that holds all allows users to share code with eachother in a more beginer friendly way, allowing new people to get used to a language like python. It is also well documented in comments so the code can be understood and used by anyone. The goal of this was to also use as little space as possible so it will remove all unessisary plugins

please enjoy, and if you would like to know anything my dms are always open!
